/*An Insurance company follows the following rules to calculate the premium.
(1) If a personâ€™s health is excellent and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives 
in a city and is a male then the premium is Rs. 4 per thousand and his policy amount cannot 
exceed Rs. 2 lakhs.
(2) If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that the sex is female then the premium 
is Rs. 3 per thousand and her policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 1 lakh.
(3) If a personâ€™s health is poor and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a 
village and is a male then the premium is Rs. 6 per thousand and his policy cannot exceed 
Rs. 10,000.
(4) In all other cases the person is not insured.
Write a program to output whether the person should be insured or not, his/her premium rate 
and maximum amount for which he/she can be insured*/
